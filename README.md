# Simple/Basic port scanners
1. The first program you must go through is the 'basicps.py' it is very easy to understand. Here, 'socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM' is used for the IP address and stream such as TCP.
2. The second program 'inputbasicps.py' is same, only here we take the user input for Host and Port number. If you run the code without adding the data type 'int' in line 6, you will face error.
3. The third 'first100ports.py' is to scan the 100 ports, using for loop and range() function.
